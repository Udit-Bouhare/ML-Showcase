# 🏡 House Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts house prices based on various features (like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) using **regression models**.  
The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying multiple ML models to a real-world dataset.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Features:** Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Location, etc.  
- **Target:** Sale Price  

---

## 🔧 Steps Involved
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling null values, encoding categorical features)  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
3. Feature engineering & scaling  
4. Model training with:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
5. Model evaluation using R² score, MAE, and RMSE  

---

## 🚀 Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **R² Score:** ~0.85  
- **RMSE:** ~28,000  

*(Update these metrics with your actual results.)*

---

## 📈 Visualizations
Here are some example plots generated during EDA:

- Distribution of house prices  
- Correlation heatmap of features  
- Predicted vs Actual prices  

*(You can insert plots as images later by saving them in a `/images/` folder.)*

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
